# Wiggle
The program works.
I added the scenarios you gave me in the requirements as tests.
Structure is simple with one class of forms, one class for printing the output.
I used dropdown menus to reduce the possibility of error.
It is made so adding new products or vouchers is extremely easy.
Although it is hinted that I should use factory pattern I had to avoid because I found the same exercise done already using that pattern. Is it a trap made by you?

As discussed in the interview I avoided dependency injection by ninject to avoid possible complications on your side, without that the structure of the program became very lean.
